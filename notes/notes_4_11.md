# Notes 4/11

* Feedback about approach: We mean that the user can choose between the abstract domains pentagons and intervals. and possibly others if they offer the same methods. 

* We try to find a fix point. we use the worklist algorithm and have widening operators etc. 

* We have to find a way to test things. Considering a file of java methdods similar to the ones given in class. a lot of methods manipulating arrays. sorting algorithms etc. or dijkstra somehow??? 

* Assosicate each test method with expected outputs. Yes or no. Run each. 

* Also time it somehow?? Figure out how to time things properly in python....

* https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html

* Try all test cases. Compare results. Also time each test case with timeit. Thats our test specification pretty much. 

* Consider being able to change change values in heap when dealing with conditionals. similar to locals. get started with other things before doing this. do it if it makes sense. 

* Read article thinking about how we actually are gonna do this and discuss it on monday (6/11).
